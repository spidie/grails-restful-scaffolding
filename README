Grails Restful Scaffolding
==========================

Note: Currently only tested with Grails 1.1

Just some code I have that I thought I should share if useful to anyone

To install. In your grails application, run:

 - grails install-templates
 - copy the contents of this project to src/templates/scaffolding 
 - regenerate your controllers and views for each model class using "grails generate-all"

Note: this is nowhere near complete yet - I am just putting the code up here as I convert it.
